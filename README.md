## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned


```css
@media (min-width: ) {

}
```
Media queries helped me achieve my mobile first approach.


### Continued development

CSS Flexbox and media queries are and area I want to continue focusing on and really dive deeper into. Layouts are very important visually and mobile first is and should be first and foremost.


### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-introduction-to-flexbox) - The Odin Project is one of the courses I'm currently taking and learning most from. The course offers much direction into a multitude of resources all presented in one place. 
- [resource 2](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/flexbox/) - This is another great article on Flexbox with some illustrations that help explain the code visually.
